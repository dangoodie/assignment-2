        <h4 class="display-8">What does it do?</h4>
      <p>
       Cybersecurity is the protection of electronic data and other assets from unauthorised use and the practices 
        and methods used to do this. In today’s world, a wealth of information is stored digitally, and these digital 
        assets may be personal and confidential. Criminals may try to gain access to and obtain this data for financial 
        gain or other malicious intents. This is why cybersecurity has become such an important technology in IT in recent 
        years. An eternal arms race exists between users trying to breach security measures to illegally access data and 
        cybersecurity experts and ends users trying to protect their data. With the ever-increasing use of devices which are 
        connected to networks, convenience and quality of life has improved greatly but this convenience of being connected 
        also brings the risk of making your data vulnerable. This is why cybersecurity has become so necessary in today’s 
        world to give us peace of mind to preserve our way of life.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are five distinct categories of cybersecurity: critical infrastructure security, application security, 
        network security, cloud security and Internet of Things (IoT) security. All these areas must be considered when 
        developing a cybersecurity plan. In addition to this, there are three key components which play an active role 
        when it comes to cybersecurity: people, processes, and technology. The human aspect of this is the easiest for 
        most people to contribute to. This focuses on what people can do themself to better protect themselves from 
        cybersecurity threats. This includes using stronger passwords and password idleness, visiting suspicious websites, 
        and sharing sensitive personally identifiable information on social media. Backing up data and limiting physical 
        access of your devices is also recommended. Processes refers to systems put in place to detect and identify 
        threats to respond and recover from them accordingly. Technology comprises of the technological tools that are 
        used to protect your information and devices like firewalls, DNS filtering and malware protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity, like the networks and data storage solutions that they protect are an ever-evolving technology. 
        It needs to adapt to recent technologies and new threats and exploits what are constantly found and abused. 
        It will keep becoming more complex as systems become more complex with multiple layers of protection required. 
        Currently, a wide array of methods is used to make sure that only authorised users can access the information they 
        are meant to see. This includes passwords and pin codes, two-factor authentication, software to protect devices 
        against malware and phishing attempts to name a few. This is used to protect things ranging from email accounts to 
        banking and other highly sensitive information. Businesses now also invest heavily in cybersecurity to protect 
        confidential data in an age where almost all data is stored digitally and can be accessed from anywhere in the world. 
        Development of new codes and software needs to be constantly created and monitored to combat malicious attacks. This 
        along with the creation of more secure devices and most importantly cybersecurity awareness and education is key to 
        protecting and preventing information from being used and stolen by unauthorised users. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">What is the likely impact?</h4>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is a necessary technology in this modern world as more information is stored digitally for increased 
        accessibility and the world and its devices and information sharing and communication through digital means has become 
        the norm. It must keep up with constant threats of malicious activity and be a primary consideration when developing new 
        software and systems. The people that will be most affected by this are everyone that lives in modern society. Everyday 
        things that we currently take for granted may be exploited if security is not kept in mind. This includes mobile devices, 
        email, internet banking and credit cards as well as personal information that is stored by the government and other 
        corporations what you have dealings with. A recent example of this is the security breaches of Optus and Medibank. 
        This data breach has impacted many people where their personal information held by those companies was accessed by criminals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As reliance on technology use continues to increase, many jobs will be created to help secure networks and prevent data loss. 
        There has been an explosion of demand for cybersecurity experts as more data is being moved online and accessibility continues to 
        increase. Few jobs will be made redundant due to this technology as currently, most information is already stored digitally and 
        not as a hardcopy. Current workers in this field will need to continue and grow their skills to keep up with the ever-changing digital landscape. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">How will this affect you?</h4>
      <p>
        In my daily life, although not always at the forefront of my mind, cybersecurity is always a concern. It keeps all the data I need 
        to go on with my daily life with convenience secure. With the devices I use, I can manage everything from finances to education 
        and healthcare with a few taps on a screen or keyboard. This convenience does come at a cost as if I can access it, others may also 
        try to do so. In such a case, the results could range from being a minor inconvenience to disastrous. Your finances may be under threat, 
        identities may be stolen with accounts being open unknowingly under your name, sensitive information may be accessed among a lengthy 
        list of other things. This is why cybersecurity is important to me and should be important to everyone. As security measures continue 
        to be created and updated, it will give me more peace of mind that my data is secure. In the meantime, I firmly believe that everyone 
        has the personal responsibility to do their best to make sure that they take their personal digital security seriously.
