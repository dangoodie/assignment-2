class="display-8">What does it do?</h4> <p> Raspberry Pi is a very small (credit
card sized) single board computer that connects to a conventional mouse,
keyboard and monitor. It was created by an educational charity based out of the
UK by the same name, Raspberry Pi foundation. Since its launch in 2012 there
have been many iterations and upgrades and as of today, different products and
accessories but Raspberry Pi foundation has always worked with the same vision.
Make computing, programming and coding cost effective, accessible, and
achievable for all people regardless of age and experience <a href="
https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/" target="_blank">(Raspberry Pi
Foundation-About us)</a>.</p> <p> Other than the Raspberry Pi 4 model B (its
newest model) Some of the other products and accessories that the charity offer
is, Raspberry Pi Pico (a new micro controller board), Raspberry Pi 400 (The
Raspberry Pi built into a keyboard and of course, the previous models. The
Raspberry Pi functions as a computer or laptop, however it is basic. Besides
computing, the Raspberry pi can interact with the outside world meaning it has
almost endless applications and is limited only to the imagination and this is
what really makes the board stand out. Some reported projects are, a retro
arcade game, Robotics, doorbell/intercom system, broadcast a FM radio station, a
web server, twitter bot, language translator the list is endless. A recent
project where the Raspberry Pi 4 was used to refurbish a 1940’s Philco radio
shows how this new technology can be used to rejuvenate old technology. Check
out the report <a href="

Raspberry Pi</a> ( Reported by Ashley Whittaker 2023). With all the new
accessories and parts that are launching future applications are exciting to say
the least. <h4 class="display-8">What is the likely impact?</h4> <p>A common
argument with the advance in technology is job loss. I will explain why this is
not something that we should be concerned about with the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Some statistics I found by a quick google review which had I owned I Rapberry
Pi I could do this on it, 40% of the world’s population has access to the
internet, 90% of the world’s data was generated within the past two years alone,
5 billion people in the world own a mobile device, 1 in every 5 Americans is
smartphone-dependent and Mobile banking adoption will produce 95 million jobs.
according to How Fast Is Technology Growing Statistics [Updated 2022]<a href="
https://leftronic.com/blog/how-fast-is-technology-growing-statistics/#:~:text=How%20Fast%20Is%20Technology%20Growing%20Statistics%3A%20Editor%E2%80%99s%20Choice,in%20every%205%20Americans%20is%20smartphone-dependent.%20More%20items"
target="_blank">(leftronic.com)</a>(Authored by Darina L).</p> <p>What makes the
Raspberry Pi unique in the computing industry is its price point (starting at
$35.00). As you can see from the statistics, each year humanity is relying on
technology and computing increasingly. It is fair to say, computing, programming
and coding isn’t for everyone, however without it our current way of life would
cease to exist and that is why the Raspberry Pi foundation along with its
pocket-sized computer and education is more important than ever. What makes the
IT industry complex is the vast array of positions/job and the demand for these
roles.  The Raspberry PI foundation is helping people access the education using
its extremely reasonably priced Raspberry Pi to increase their skills.</p> <h4
class="display-8">How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>Currently, I have no experience using a Raspberry Pi and the supporting technologies so it would not have a particularly significant impact on my life. After learning more about it and what it can do however, a great many things can be projected and learned with this device. It would also provide a fantastic tool and platform for children to adults to get to learn programming in an exciting was as they will be able to directly see their contributions at work. Building simple programs with this tool may also be helpful to automate small tasks in your life that may save you some time, provide you entertainment or improve your quality of life. However, this technology would not cause a large shift in lifestyle changes currently though this technology, being able to do such diverse tasks, may be doing simple tasks to benefit you with you even noticing. </p>
