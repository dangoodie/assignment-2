        Raspberry Pi is a very small (credit card sized) single board computer
        that connects to a conventional mouse, keyboard and monitor. It was
        created by an educational charity based out of the UK by the same name,
        Raspberry Pi foundation. Since its launch in 2012 there have been many
        iterations and upgrades and as of today, different products and
        accessories but Raspberry Pi foundation has always worked with the same
        vision. Make computing, programming and coding cost effective,
        accessible, and achievable for all people regardless of age and
        experience (Raspberry Pi Foundation – About us). Other than the
        Raspberry Pi 4 model B (its newest model) Some of the other products and
        accessories that the charity offer is, Raspberry Pi Pico (a new micro
        controller board), Raspberry Pi 400 (The Raspberry Pi built into a
        keyboard and of course, the previous models. The Raspberry Pi functions
        as a computer or laptop, however it is basic. Besides computing, the
        Raspberry pi can interact with the outside world meaning it has almost
        endless applications and is limited only to the imagination and this is
        what really makes the board stand out. Some reported projects are, a
        retro arcade game, Robotics, doorbell/intercom system, broadcast a FM
        radio station, a web server, twitter bot, language translator the list
        is endless. A recent project where the Raspberry Pi 4 was used to
        refurbish a 1940’s Philco radio shows how this new technology can be
        used to rejuvenate old technology. Check out the report <a

          target="_blank">1940s Philco radio sings again with new Raspberry Pi heart - Raspberry Pi</a>
        ( Reported by Ashley Whittaker 2023). With all the new accessories and parts that
        are launching future applications are exciting to say the least. What
        makes the Raspberry Pi unique in the computing industry is its price
        point (starting at $35.00). With each year humanity is relying on
        technology and computing more and more. It is fair to say, computing,
        programming and coding isn’t for everyone, however without it our
        current way of life would cease to exist and that is why the Raspberry
        Pi foundation along with its pocket-sized computer education is more
        important than ever. A common argument with the advance in technology is
        loss of jobs. This is not something that we should be concerned about
        with the Raspberry Pi.
