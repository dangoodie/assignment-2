    <h3>Overview - BowWow</h3>
    <p>
      Develop a phone app to track great places to take your dog in the local area. The app would be primarily smartphone based but also have an online presence. Some features of the app include location based searches, local area suggestions, ratings of the area, photo sharing, and reviews by other users. The app would have a user sign up that allows users to upload information about themselves, their dogs, what they like to do, and interact with other users by way of suggestions and reviews, which would then allow users to make informed decisions about what to do with their dog.
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      There are 29 million pets in Australia and 40% of them are dogs, with 61% of the population being pet owners. The market to have an impact is large if we can tap into people's growing interest in doing activities with their dog. The app will help solve problems for pet owners who want to get out there and go on a big walk with their dogs but don't know where to go next. By checking the app, they could potentially unlock new places just around the corner that they were not aware of.

      Description
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have had so many issues through the years finding spots to take our dogs as well as finding out relevant information such as whether dogs are allowed, whether its off-leash, what kind of facilities are available etc. Usually my partner and I just resort to looking up a blog online that was posted many years ago or just risking it. Just the other week, we took our dogs to some markets, which is usually a safe bet, and ended up turning around as they were not allowed inside. Things like this can be avoided by an app where you can look up activities, such as the local markets, and see what other users have posted about. In our case, we would have been able to see that dogs are not allowed, but there is a designated spot to leash them up, and water bowls for them. The app would contain all of this information and more. When the user logs into the app for the first time, they will be greeted by a screen asking them to sign up. Their they will be prompted to give user details, such as name, a photo, dog name, dog information, and preferences for types of activities. From there, they will be asked to share their location and enable notifications. By sharing location, we will be able to look for the top activities that match their preferences. These activities would be served up to the user with the option to select an activity or save them for later. When selecting a new activity, we would prompt the user to enter information such as whether off-leash, dog bowls available, photos etc. to give them points. The points directly go to their score which will give them levels. This offers some kind of internal reward such as titles of local guide to the user to help encourage them to continue using the app and sending relevant, up to date data for us to serve up to other users. It is this constant stream of data that will make this app unique. I want users to enjoy using the app so that they will continue to come back and be happy to help give recommendations to their local dog community. The look and feel of the app will be minimal and easy quickly navigate. I want users to quickly check, make a plan, and answer a few questions when prompted. It should be a simple tool that users can tap into to help find a new recommendation for their dog. The interface would be similar to Google Maps, with highlighted locations that are suggestions of places to take your dog. Some of the different options can be, off-leash parks, restaurants and cafes that are dog friendly, trails that allow dogs, and beaches that let dogs off leash. By having the user set their preferences, they would get suggested places that line up with their preferences bolder than other suggestions. There would also be a search bar that lets them search through the database, serving up places that match within a certain radius that the user can set.

    <h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      For tools, we would need a setup that would allow the team working on it to test smartphone apps. An app testing suite, such as Sofy, would work, but I have no experience building smartphone apps. I plan on building it in React Native as I am familiar with React. This would allow the app to be developed both for iOS and Android simultaneously. I would also need a backend server to store user and location information and serve it up to the users. I have experience using Node.js with an Express.js framework so I would probably use this as my backend. This would also mean the whole project is written in Javascript, which helps simplify the development process.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript is a major skill required for both the frontend and the backend. The frontend would be written in React Native, so knowledge for React and React Native is required. Node.js and Express.js knowledge is required to write the code for the backend. Knowledge of complex database types is also required. For the type of data we are dealing with, a NoSQL database is probably the best solution so that we can scale the app as it is built and add features.
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      If this project is successful, I will be able to help impact local dog communities to help owners spend quality time with their pooch. The problem of finding something fun and new to do with your dog will no longer be an issue. A user can have all the data they need at their fingertips to help find something to do with their dog. In the end, this will create a stronger bond with their animal and help local dog communities come together to show off the best places to spend time together.
