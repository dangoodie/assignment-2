      <h4 class="display-8">What does it do?</h4>
      <p>
        An autonomous vehicle is a self-driving vehicle that uses sensors and
        software to navigate through its surroundings and environment to operate
        without any human input or involvement. Currently, there are various
        levels of automation that a vehicle may have ranging from minimal human
        input to fully autonomous. Most of these vehicles currently require
        human input or intervention in emergency situations or when the system
        cannot act appropriately. As a newly emerging technology, there have
        been many advances within the past years although due to safety
        concerns, moral issues, and lack of infrastructure to support this
        technology, progress toward a fully autonomous vehicle may still be q
        uite some while away. Due to the nature of this technology, as it
        involves physical interaction with the physical environment, safety is
        of utmost importance as any errors may cause harm, injury, or death. As
        a result, it will take quite some time for this technology to reach
        maturity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several vehicle manufacturers currently offer vehicles with a great deal
        of driver assistance or partial automation including Tesla and Mercedes
        Benz, among others. The systems in this vehicle take control of
        accelerating, braking, and steering but require the user to monitor the
        driving and intervene when a response is required. These systems
        currently only work in certain areas where the area has been carefully
        mapped out and approval from the government granted. Commercially,
        automated vehicles have been tested in the public transport, taxi
        services, and freight transportation industries. The trucking industry
        has a great interest in this technology as it not only makes
        transportation safer, but also a large amount of fuel can be saved
        through a technique known a platooning which uses a convoy of trucks
        following closely together to reduce air resistance for better fuel
        economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As advances in this field continue, automated systems will be further
        refined with additional testing. The complexity of this technology means
        that there will be many obstacles to overcome and supporting
        infrastructure to be placed in the pursuit of a truly autonomous
        vehicle. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for this system
        is crucial as it will allow these vehicles to make the best decisions
        when they experience unexpected encounters such as roadworks,
        pedestrians, cyclists, and wildlife. More advanced cameras, sensors, and
        supporting software will also be required to help these vehicles
        navigate the physical environment. High-definition maps with continuous
        updates, developments in vehicular communication with peer-to-peer
        networks, and modifications in current road infrastructure will also be
        needed to support this system.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">What is the likely impact?</h4>
      <p>
        The development and perfection of autonomous vehicles will significantly
        impact on all people in human society. Without the need to focus on
        controlling a vehicle and giving attention to the surrounding
        environment, people can dedicate themselves to more important tasks
        while they commute. This may not only include being more productive with
        work and other tasks, but also more relaxation and leisure time. If
        applied correctly, road safety will be improved with more advanced AI
        and vehicular communication working together to reduce accidents and
        help traffic flow more efficiently. This would result in a potentially
        safer and faster commute. Advances in vehicular communication may also
        eliminate the need for traffic signals which would result in an even
        more efficient traffic system. One of the main safety concerns will be
        for pedestrians as they must now rely on AI with advanced sensors to be
        able to avoid them. One solution to this problem would be to create
        infrastructure which would eliminate the need for pedestrians to be on
        the road such as overhead walkways and bridges.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of job creation, this emerging technology is a double-edged
        sword. People currently employed as a driver in a vehicle such as
        rideshare/taxi drivers and truck drivers among others will no longer be
        necessary and will need to seek other alternatives for employment.
        However, on the positive note, I believe more jobs will be created than
        lost with this technology. A large workforce will be required to create,
        update, and maintain autonomous vehicles and the infrastructure and
        industries that will be necessary to support this technology. This would
        lead people into more creative and inventive tasks as AI handles the
        lesser daily activities.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">How will this affect you?</h4>
      <p>
        In the current state, this IT technology has minor impact on my daily
        life as the technology is still in its infancy and as a result, is not
        widely used, especially in Australia. The current benefits of this
        technology are the supporting technologies which will be required, with
        further development, for a truly autonomous vehicle such as cruise
        control, cameras, and various sensors and driver aids in found current
        vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this technology reaches maturity, it will have a profound impact on
        my daily life along with the people that surround me and all of society.
        It would grant us something that we are all sorely lacking in this
        world: more time. Instead of focus and concentration directed at
        navigation when commuting, I could better use this time for work, study,
        leisure, or even getting more rest. The efficiency of all these
        components and systems of autonomous vehicles working together would
        also mean smoother traffic flow resulting in less time spent commuting,
        freeing up even more time for more important things. This efficiency
        would hopefully also mean that less traffic accidents would occur
        resulting in a safer world.
