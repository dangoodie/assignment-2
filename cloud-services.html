        The cloud. An amazing introduction to the everyday use of technology and
        what a significant impact it has had. Gone the days of having hard
        drives in every corner of one's desk, or a pencil case full of USB flash
        drives, everything is now in the cloud. Many wonder what this mysterious
        cloud really is. According to Microsoft;  The definition for the cloud
        can seem murky, but essentially, it’s a term used to describe a global
        network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a
        physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around
        the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single
        ecosystem. These servers are designed to either store and manage data,
        run applications, or deliver content or a service such as streaming
        videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. Instead
        of accessing files and data from a local or personal computer, you are
        accessing them online from any Internet-capable device—the information
        will be available anywhere you go and anytime you need it.    It may
        seem that the same technology is essentially still being used, since
        these services are still being hosted from a physical device (or
        server), just not on premises, rather in a datacentre(s). This has had
        an enormous impact not only on individuals but also for enterprise use.
        Companies are now able to outsource a lot of their work and not have to
        worry about regular maintenance and other work that is involved in
        troubleshooting these resources. An example of this would be migrating
        locally storage files to either Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive,
        which is also stored in the cloud (I.e., in Microsoft and Googles
        Datacentres). Another example would be having a less reliant on an
        on-premises Domain Controller and domain joining their devices to what
        is called the Active Directory, Users and Computers. This can now be
        done of premises in what is called Microsoft Azure, or Azure Active
        Directory, all through the cloud.  As can be seen from the above, there
        are a variety of services inherent with cloud computing. These mainly
        revolve around Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service
        (SaaS), and finally Platform as a Service (PaaS).  There are a variety
        of factors that have pushed for the need and increase demand for cloud
        computing. These include but are not limited to economic benefits. This
        is referring to the cost savings for companies on hardware, but also the
        costs saved on wages and workers. Regular maintenance of on premises
        servers in now no longer required as cloud-based servers are stored and
        managed through a datacentre. Another enormous driving factor is
        security. Many firms struggle to properly implement means of security
        for their infrastructure, due to many factors, however, cloud-based
        services have full time security teams managing their clients'
        services.
