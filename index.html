                <p class="card-text">I completed my final year of high school in 2021. I started my first year out of high school studying for a Bachelor of Civil Engineering at UTS in Sydney. I was not particularly enjoying this course, and at the time I was working as an IT Support Technician for a school (in fact continuing this role today). This role helped me develop a significant interest in IT among other things, so I began to do some research into courses that would allow me to work while studying remotely. RMIT was on top of that list due its flexibility and online format. Both my parents are Lebanese, but I was born in Sydney. English is that the main language at home, though sometime Arabic is spoken when my grandparents visit. A hobby that I have held onto throughout my entire schooling life is playing and recording music on my guitar and drums. I am also a huge cricket fan, keeping an eye on the score for all of Australiaâ€™s test matches.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I was born in Townsville QLD and married with no children living in the Gold Coast QLD.I am currently working in construction as a Plasterer and have been in the industry for 19 years. I graduated year 12 in 2002 and I have a trade in plastering and carpentry. I enjoy the beach and water sports. My wife and I own a 6.1m Quintrex Ocean sport boat. We plan to travel around Australia mid-2023. My interest in IT started when I completed computer studies in year 11 and 12 and graduated with a certificate three in information technology. Although I have not worked in the IT industry, it has played a significant role within my working life. I have found myself soul searching this last year, this has brought on the desire to change my career. My goal is to work within Cyber security/defense. </p>

                <p class="card-text">I was born in Malaysia but migrated to Perth, Australia at  an  early  age where  I  started  my education.  After finishing secondary school,  I  tried  a  few  courses  at  university  including architecture  and  engineering  but  found  that  they did  not hold  my interest, so  I  joined  the workforce in various roles in hospitality and currently, in retail. I primarily communicate in English though, I can understand Mandarin and the Hakka dialect well, although  unfortunately,  my communication with them is very weak. I love nature, wildlife, and photography which makes hiking one of my go-to activities. Other interests also include reading, baking, and cooking. My interest in IT stems from the fascination of how technology can improve the quality of life in our daily routines to make things easier and more accessible to people. This started at an early age when my father  brought  home  our  first PC to  improve  our  education .Since then, my experience in IT has mostly been personal in nature. I briefly  worked  as  a  contractor  to  a  large hospital to help in the rollout of new hardware to update older systems.</p>

                <p class="card-text">I am a lighting director for the ABC, and I am learning to code. I love coffee and beer. I have been interested in tech since I was young. I initially got into my current career as a lighting director because I loved tech so much. A job that lets you play with lights was right up my alley. Through COVID I decided that I wanted to study IT part time so that I could broaden my skills and potentially even make a career jump from industry into tech. I chose to come to RMIT because I did some courses here and I love the instructors and the system of how they teach. It is very easily laid out and I like that a lot. I had done some other tech courses and the quality of teaching at RMIT was much better. I expect to learn a lot of skills including programming, working with databases, and development. My ideal career path is web development and I am hoping that this will give me a good foundation to look for work out in the industry. </p>

                <p class="card-text">I was born in Darwin, Australia where I still live. I speak English and I am learning to speak Japanese. I graduated high school in 2009 and I participate in small classes for drawing, and creative writing with Udemy. A enjoy many hobbies and my favourites are playing games, reading, writing and drawing. My interest in IT started in the last two years of Primary School which were full computer classes. I learned about computer systems, how they work and creating website with html in notepad. I really enjoy writing programs creating applications and games. I find watching code being written and then how it is displayed fascinating.  My interest was piqued again when I met my partner who studied IT and helped me build my own PC. I work for Kinetic IT doing basic trouble shooting for the NT public service </p>
