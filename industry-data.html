        In this section we look at the ranking for demand for Ideal Jobs and the
        collective skills for general and IT.
      </p>
      <h4 class="display-8">
        What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs?
      </h4>
      <p>
        listed below are the titels for each Ideal job.
        <li>Azure Cloud Architect</li>
        <li>Network and Systems Administrator</li>
        <li>Senior Fullstack Engineer</li>
        <li>Senior Programmer - Video Games</li>
        <li>Cyber Security Analyst</li>

      <h4 class="display-8">
        How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Looking at the data given for the demand of the ideal jobs we were able
        to make graphs showing the lowest to highest for both ideal and similar
        jobs. There is also a table showing the shortage in Australia and the
        future demand for the ideal jobs.

        Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal
        job changed? Why or why not?
      </h4>
      <p>Phillip Abboud: After thinking about my ideal job multiple times since 
        the first assignment I have decided not to change this. I am really 
        intrigued by the work that Network Administrators take apart in and am 
        excited to one day be able to troubleshoot and deploy network infrastructure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stewart Altoft: I have not changed my opinion on my ideal job. According
        to the graphs Cyber security is not the most ideal position though it
        isnâ€™t the least desirable meaning the job prospects are positive and all
        though it requires a lot of training. I still believe I will find Cyber
        Security a challenging and rewarding career. I have however enjoyed
        collaborating on GitHub with my team. I am surprised about how much I
        have enjoyed writing code. It has most definitely got me curious and
        given me a nudge to want to learn more. This could well be the start of
        a new hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jihn Nyen Chong: My opinion of my ideal job has not changed as I still
        believe that I would enjoy the tasks required of that line of
        technology. Also, the job prospects in my desired field look quite
        promising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel Gooden: I still am excited about becoming a fullstack engineer
        and am still pursuing this ideal job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jamie Virgen: My opinion has not changed because I would rather do my
        ideal job which I find fun and I enjoying learning the skills required
        for it rather than trying to learn something that I find no enjoyment
        in.
